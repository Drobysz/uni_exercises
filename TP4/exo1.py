# 1) Creation of lists

# When we use comand "append" it just appends its single object argument to the subject list. Finally it returns the same list with the new item at the end.
# But when we use operator "+", operation concatenates 2 lists and returns a new list.
# This opearation takes more time to be executed.

# 2) Deletion of lists

# pop() removes last item in the list.
# pop(0) removes 1st item in the list, it means your program get back to the 1st index to delete it.
